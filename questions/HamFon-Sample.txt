The file format is one question per line.  use a '/' as a delimiter.
The first item is the "catetory" - History, etc.  I use the standard
Trivial Pursuit categories...
The next (up to 5) are answers.  Generally, the first is the complete
correct answer, and the next (optional) ones are matches that will be
accepted.  It's NOT case sensitive, but is spacing sensitive.  The end
of the answers is marked by a '//' followed by the text of the question.
Answers that are 4 or shorter characters must match EXACTLY.
